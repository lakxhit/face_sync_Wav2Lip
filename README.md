 Wav2Lip HQ local installation, fully running on Torch to ONNX converted models for:
- face-detection
- face-recognition
- face-alignment
- face-parsing
- face-enhancement
- wav2lip inference.



Can be run on CPU or Nvidia GPU

I've made some modifications such as:
* New face-detection and face-alignment code. (working for ~ +- 60ยบ head tilt)
* Four different face enhancers available, adjustable enhancement level .
* Choose pingpong loop instead of original loop function.
* Set cut-in/cut-out position to create the loop or cut longer video.
* Cut-in position = used frame if static is selected.
* Select the target face.
* Use two audio files, eg. vocal for driving and full music mix for final output.
* This version does not crash if no face is detected, it just continues ...

Type --help for all commandline parameters
